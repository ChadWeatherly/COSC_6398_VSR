Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3 × 3) convolution ﬁlters, which shows that a signiﬁcant improvement on the prior-art conﬁgurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16–19 weight layers. These ﬁndings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the ﬁrst and the second places in the localisation and classiﬁcation tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.},

This paper reviews the NTIRE 2021 Challenge on Image Deblurring. In this challenge report, we describe the challenge speciﬁcs and the evaluation results from the 2 competition tracks with the proposed solutions. While both the tracks aim to recover a highquality clean image from a blurry image, different artifacts are jointly involved. In track 1, the blurry images are in a low resolution while track 2 images are compressed in JPEG format. In each competition, there were 338 and 238 registered participants and in the ﬁnal testing phase, 18 and 17 teams competed. The winning methods demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance on the image deblurring task with the jointly combined artifacts.},

	abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are inherently limited to model geometric transformations due to the ﬁxed geometric structures in their building modules. In this work, we introduce two new modules to enhance the transformation modeling capability of CNNs, namely, deformable convolution and deformable RoI pooling. Both are based on the idea of augmenting the spatial sampling locations in the modules with additional offsets and learning the offsets from the target tasks, without additional supervision. The new modules can readily replace their plain counterparts in existing CNNs and can be easily trained end-to-end by standard back-propagation, giving rise to deformable convolutional networks. Extensive experiments validate the performance of our approach. For the ﬁrst time, we show that learning dense spatial transformation in deep CNNs is effective for sophisticated vision tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation.

	title = {Recurrent {Video} {Restoration} {Transformer} with {Guided} {Deformable} {Attention}},
	abstract = {Video restoration aims at restoring multiple high-quality frames from multiple lowquality frames. Existing video restoration methods generally fall into two extreme cases, i.e., they either restore all frames in parallel or restore the video frame by frame in a recurrent way, which would result in different merits and drawbacks. Typically, the former has the advantage of temporal information fusion. However, it suffers from large model size and intensive memory consumption; the latter has a relatively small model size as it shares parameters across frames; however, it lacks long-range dependency modeling ability and parallelizability. In this paper, we attempt to integrate the advantages of the two cases by proposing a recurrent video restoration transformer, namely RVRT. RVRT processes local neighboring frames in parallel within a globally recurrent framework which can achieve a good trade-off between model size, effectiveness, and efficiency. Specifically, RVRT divides the video into multiple clips and uses the previously inferred clip feature to estimate the subsequent clip feature. Within each clip, different frame features are jointly updated with implicit feature aggregation. Across different clips, the guided deformable attention is designed for clip-to-clip alignment, which predicts multiple relevant locations from the whole inferred clip and aggregates their features by the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on video super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising show that the proposed RVRT achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets with balanced model size, testing memory and runtime.

	abstract = {By decomposing the image formation process into a sequential application of denoising autoencoders, diffusion models (DMs) achieve state-of-the-art synthesis results on image data and beyond. Additionally, their formulation allows for a guiding mechanism to control the image generation process without retraining. However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and ﬂexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the ﬁrst time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual ﬁdelity. By introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into powerful and ﬂexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional manner. Our latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve new state of the art scores for image inpainting and class-conditional image synthesis and highly competitive performance on various tasks, including unconditional image generation, text-to-image synthesis, and super-resolution, while signiﬁcantly reducing computational requirements compared to pixel-based DMs.},

Despite this, the most widely used perceptual metrics today, such as PSNR and SSIM, are simple, shallow functions, and fail to account for many nuances of human perception. Recently, the deep learning community has found that features of the VGG network trained on ImageNet classiﬁcation has been remarkably useful as a training loss for image synthesis. But how perceptual are these so-called “perceptual losses”? What elements are critical for their success? To answer these questions, we introduce a new dataset of human perceptual similarity judgments. We systematically evaluate deep features across different architectures and tasks and compare them with classic metrics. We ﬁnd that deep features outperform all previous metrics by large margins on our dataset. More surprisingly, this result is not restricted to ImageNet-trained VGG features, but holds across different deep architectures and levels of supervision (supervised, self-supervised, or even unsupervised). Our results suggest that perceptual similarity is an emergent property shared across deep visual representations.},

We combine the benefits of both approaches, and propose the use of perceptual loss functions for training feed-forward networks for image transformation tasks. We show results on image style transfer, where a feed-forward network is trained to solve the optimization problem proposed by Gatys et al. in real-time. Compared to the optimization-based method, our network gives similar qualitative results but is three orders of magnitude faster.

	title = {Rethinking {Alignment} in {Video} {Super}-{Resolution} {Transformers}},
	abstract = {The alignment of adjacent frames is considered an essential operation in video super-resolution (VSR). Advanced VSR models, including the latest VSR Transformers, are generally equipped with well-designed alignment modules. However, the progress of the self-attention mechanism may violate this common sense. In this paper, we rethink the role of alignment in VSR Transformers and make several counter-intuitive observations. Our experiments show that: (i) VSR Transformers can directly utilize multi-frame information from unaligned videos, and (ii) existing alignment methods are sometimes harmful to VSR Transformers. These observations indicate that we can further improve the performance of VSR Transformers simply by removing the alignment module and adopting a larger attention window. Nevertheless, such designs will dramatically increase the computational burden, and cannot deal with large motions. Therefore, we propose a new and efficient alignment method called patch alignment, which aligns image patches instead of pixels. VSR Transformers equipped with patch alignment could demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Our work provides valuable insights on how multi-frame information is used in VSR and how to select alignment methods for different networks/datasets.

We show that this model provides state of the art predictive log-likelihood and tighter log-likelihood lower bound compared to the purely bottom-up inference in layered Variational Autoencoders and other generative models. We provide a detailed analysis of the learned hierarchical latent representation and show that our new inference model is qualitatively different and utilizes a deeper more distributed hierarchy of latent variables.

In this work, we tackle the problem of diverse super-resolution by reusing VD-VAE, a state-of-the art variational autoencoder (VAE). We ﬁnd that the hierarchical latent representation learned by VD-VAE naturally separates the image low-frequency information, encoded in the latent groups at the top of the hierarchy, from the image high-frequency details, determined by the latent groups at the bottom of the latent hierarchy. Starting from this observation, we design a super-resolution model exploiting the speciﬁc structure of VD-VAE latent space. Speciﬁcally, we train an encoder to encode low-resolution images in the subset of VD-VAE latent space encoding the low-frequency information, and we combine this encoder with VD-VAE generative model to sample diverse super-resolved version of a low-resolution input. We demonstrate the ability of our method to generate diverse solutions to the super-resolution problem on face super-resolution with upsampling factors ×4, ×8 and ×16.},

Most existing methods are optimized for deterministic generation of SR images under pre-deﬁned objectives such as pixel-level reconstruction and thus limited to the one-to-one correspondence between LR and SR images against the nature. In this paper, we propose VarSR, Variational Super Resolution Network, that matches latent distributions of LR and HR images to recover the missing details. Speciﬁcally, we draw samples from the learned common latent distribution of LR and HR to generate diverse SR images as the many-to-one relationship.

Despite this, autoregressive models have historically outperformed VAEs in loglikelihood. We test if insufﬁcient depth explains why by scaling a VAE to greater stochastic depth than previously explored and evaluating it CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and FFHQ. In comparison to the PixelCNN, these very deep VAEs achieve higher likelihoods, use fewer parameters, generate samples thousands of times faster, and are more easily applied to high-resolution images.

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel reference based image super-resolution approach via Variational AutoEncoder (RefVAE). Existing state-of-the-art methods mainly focus on single image super-resolution which cannot perform well on large upsampling factors, e.g., 8×. We propose a reference based image super-resolution, for which any arbitrary image can act as a reference for super-resolution. Even using random map or low-resolution image itself, the proposed RefVAE can transfer the knowledge from the reference to the super-resolved images. Depending upon different references, the proposed method can generate diﬀerent versions of super-resolved images from a hidden superresolution space. Besides using diﬀerent datasets for some standard evaluations with PSNR and SSIM, we also took part in the NTIRE2021 SR Space challenge [29] and have provided results of the randomness evaluation of our approach. Compared to other state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves higher diverse scores.},

Until now, deep generative models such as autoregressive models and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have proven to be effective at modelling high-resolution images. VAE-based models have often been criticised for their feeble generative performance, but with new advancements such as VDVAE, there is now strong evidence that deep VAEs have the potential to outperform current state-of-the-art models for high-resolution image generation. In this paper, we introduce VDVAE-SR, a new model that aims to exploit the most recent deep VAE methodologies to improve upon the results of similar models. VDVAE-SR tackles image super-resolution using transfer learning on pretrained VDVAEs. The presented model is competitive with other state-of-the-art models, having comparable results on image quality metrics.},

	abstract = {Improving road safety is critical for the sustainable development of cities. A road safety map is a powerful tool that can help prevent future traffic accidents. However, accurate mapping requires accurate data collection, which is both expensive and labor intensive. Satellite imagery is increasingly becoming abundant, higher in resolution and affordable. Given the recent successes deep learning has achieved in the visual recognition field, we are interested in investigating whether it is possible to use deep learning to accurately predict road safety directly from raw satellite imagery. To this end, we propose a deep learning-based mapping approach that leverages open data to learn from raw satellite imagery robust deep models able to predict accurate city-scale road safety maps at an affordable cost. To empirically validate the proposed approach, we trained a deep model on satellite images obtained from over 647 thousand traffic-accident reports collected over a period of four years by the New York city Police Department. The best model predicted road safety from raw satellite imagery with an accuracy of 78\%. We also used the New York city model to predict for the city of Denver a city-scale map indicating road safety in three levels. Compared to a map made from three years' worth of data collected by the Denver city Police Department, the map predicted from raw satellite imagery has an accuracy of 73\%.},

	abstract = {Traffic accident data are usually noisy, contain missing values, and heterogeneous. How to select the most important variables to improve real-time traffic accident risk prediction has become a concern of many recent studies. This paper proposes a novel variable selection method based on the Frequent Pattern tree (FP tree) algorithm. First, all the frequent patterns in the traffic accident dataset are discovered. Then for each frequent pattern, a new criterion, called the Relative Object Purity Ratio (ROPR) which we proposed, is calculated. This ROPR is added to the importance score of the variables that differentiates one frequent pattern from the others. To test the proposed method, a dataset was compiled from the traffic accidents records detected by only one detector on interstate highway I-64 in Virginia in 2005. This data set was then linked to other variables such as real-time traffic information and weather conditions. Both the proposed method based on the FP tree algorithm, as well as the widely utilized, random forest method, were then used to identify the important variables or the Virginia data set. The results indicate that there are some differences between the variables deemed important by the FP tree and those selected by the random forest method. Following this, two baseline models (i.e. a nearest neighbor (k-NN) method and a Bayesian network) were developed to predict accident risk based on the variables identified by both the FP tree method and the random forest method. The results show that the models based on the variable selection using the FP tree performed better than those based on the random forest method for several versions of the k-NN and Bayesian network models. The best results were derived from a Bayesian network model using variables from FP tree. That model could predict 61.11\% of accidents accurately, while having a false alarm rate of 38.16\%.},

	abstract = {One of the key objectives in accident data analysis to identify the main factors associated with a road and traffic accident. However, heterogeneous nature of road accident data makes the analysis task difficult. Data segmentation has been used widely to overcome this heterogeneity of the accident data. In this paper, we proposed a framework that used K-modes clustering technique as a preliminary task for segmentation of 11,574 road accidents on road network of Dehradun (India) between 2009 and 2014 (both included). Next, association rule mining are used to identify the various circumstances that are associated with the occurrence of an accident for both the entire data set (EDS) and the clusters identified by K-modes clustering algorithm. The findings of cluster based analysis and entire data set analysis are then compared. The results reveal that the combination of k mode clustering and association rule mining is very inspiring as it produces important information that would remain hidden if no segmentation has been performed prior to generate association rules. Further a trend analysis have also been performed for each clusters and EDS accidents which finds different trends in different cluster whereas a positive trend is shown by EDS. Trend analysis also shows that prior segmentation of accident data is very important before analysis.},

And these DRs can be used to identify safety problems and establish certain measures of performance. However, when only one DT is used, rule extraction is limited to the structure of that DT and some important relationships between variables cannot be extracted. This paper presents a more effective method for extracting rules from DTs. The method's effectiveness when applied to a particular traffic accident dataset is shown. Specifically, our study focuses on traffic accident data from rural roads in Granada (Spain) from 2003 to 2009 (both included). The results show that we can obtain more than 70 relevant rules from our data using the new method, whereas with only one DT we would have extracted only five relevant rules from the same dataset.},

Using small-scale datasets with limited coverage, being dependent on extensive set of data, and being not applicable for real-time purposes are the important shortcomings of the existing studies. To address these challenges, we propose a new solution for real-time traffic accident prediction using easy-to-obtain, but sparse data. Our solution relies on a deep-neural-network model (which we have named DAP, for Deep Accident Prediction); which utilizes a variety of data attributes such as traffic events, weather data, points-of-interest, and time. DAP incorporates multiple components including a recurrent (for time-sensitive data), a fully connected (for time-insensitive data), and a trainable embedding component (to capture spatial heterogeneity). To fill the data gap, we have - through a comprehensive process of data collection, integration, and augmentation - created a large-scale publicly available database of accident information named US-Accidents. By employing the US-Accidents dataset and through an extensive set of experiments across several large cities, we have evaluated our proposal against several baselines. Our analysis and results show significant improvements to predict rare accident events. Further, we have shown the impact of traffic information, time, and points-of-interest data for real-time accident prediction.},

This research provides valuable information for team and player performance basketball analytics to be used for better understanding of the game. Furthermore, these analytics can be used for team composition, athlete career improvement and assessing how this could be materialized for future predictions. Hence, critical analysis of these metrics are valuable tools for domain experts and decision makers to understand the strengths and weaknesses in the game, to better evaluate opponent teams, to see how to optimize performance indicators, to use them for team and player forecasting and finally to make better choices for team composition.},

	abstract = {The plant disease classiﬁcation based on using digital images is very challenging. In the last decade, machine learning techniques and plant images classiﬁcation tools such as deep learning can be used for recognizing, detecting and diagnosing plant diseases. Currently, deep learning technology has been used for plant disease detection and classiﬁcation. In this paper, an ensemble model of two pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) namely VGG16 and VGG19 have been developed for the task plant disease diagnosis by classifying the leaves images of healthy and unhealthy. In this context, CNNs are used due to its capability of overcoming the technical problems which are associated with the classiﬁcation problem of plant diseases. However, CNNs suffer from a great variety of hyperparameters with speciﬁc architectures which is considered as a challenge to identify manually the optimal hyperparameters. Therefore, orthogonal learning particle swarm optimization (OLPSO) algorithm is utilized in this paper to optimize a number of these hyperparameters by ﬁnding optimal values for these hyperparameters rather than using traditional methods such as the manual trial and error method. In this paper, to prevent CNNs from falling into the local minimum and to train efﬁciently, an exponentially decaying learning rate (EDLR) schema is used. In this paper, the problem of the imbalanced used dataset has been solved by using random minority oversampling and random majority undersampling methods, and some restrictions in terms of both the number and diversity of samples have been overcome. The obtained results of this work show that the accuracy of the proposed model is very competitive. The experimental results are compared with the performance of other pre-trained CNN models namely InceptionV3 and Xception, whose hyperparameters were selected using a non-evolutionary method. The comparison results demonstrated that the proposed diagnostic approach has achieved higher performance than the other models.},

In this paper, an ensemble model of two pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) namely VGG16 and VGG19 have been developed for the task plant disease diagnosis by classifying the leaves images of healthy and unhealthy. In this context, CNNs are used due to its capability of overcoming the technical problems which are associated with the classification problem of plant diseases. However, CNNs suffer from a great variety of hyperparameters with specific architectures which is considered as a challenge to identify manually the optimal hyperparameters. Therefore, orthogonal learning particle swarm optimization (OLPSO) algorithm is utilized in this paper to optimize a number of these hyperparameters by finding optimal values for these hyperparameters rather than using traditional methods such as the manual trial and error method. In this paper, to prevent CNNs from falling into the local minimum and to train efficiently, an exponentially decaying learning rate (EDLR) schema is used. In this paper, the problem of the imbalanced used dataset has been solved by using random minority oversampling and random majority undersampling methods, and some restrictions in terms of both the number and diversity of samples have been overcome. The obtained results of this work show that the accuracy of the proposed model is very competitive. The experimental results are compared with the performance of other pre-trained CNN models namely InceptionV3 and Xception, whose hyperparameters were selected using a non-evolutionary method. The comparison results demonstrated that the proposed diagnostic approach has achieved higher performance than the other models.},

	abstract = {There are several limitations that facing intrusion-detection system in current days, such as high rates of false positive alerts, low detection rates of rare but dangerous attacks. Daily, there are reports of incidents such as major ex-filtration of data for the purposes of stealing identities. Hybrid model's approaches have been widely used to increase the effectiveness of intrusion-detection platforms. This work proposes the extreme learning machine (ELM) is one of the poplar machine learning algorithms which, easy to implement with excellent learning performance characteristics. However, the internal power parameters (weight and basis) of ELM are initialized at random, causing the algorithm to be unstable. The Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a well-known meta-heuristic which is used in this research to optimize the ELM. Our propose model has been apple based as intrusion detection and validated based on NSL-KDD data set. Our developed model has been compared against a basic ELM. PSO-ELM has outperformed a basic model in the testing accuracy.},

	abstract = {The prediction of heart disease is one of the areas where machine learning can be implemented. Optimization algorithms have the advantage of dealing with complex non-linear problems with a good flexibility and adaptability. In this paper, we exploited the Fast Correlation-Based Feature Selection (FCBF) method to filter redundant features in order to improve the quality of heart disease classification. Then, we perform a classification based on different classification algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest and a Multilayer Perception {\textbar} Artificial Neural Network optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) combined with Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) approaches. The proposed mixed approach is applied to heart disease dataset; the results demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of the proposed hybrid method in processing various types of data for heart disease classification. Therefore, this study examines the different machine learning algorithms and compares the results using different performance measures, i.e. accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, etc. A maximum classification accuracy of 99.65\% using the optimized model proposed by FCBF, PSO and ACO. The results show that the performance of the proposed system is superior to that of the classification technique presented above.},

	abstract = {Swarm behaviour, or swarming, is a collective behaviour exhibited by entities, particularly animals, of similar size which aggregate together, perhaps milling about the same spot or perhaps moving en masse or migrating in some direction. It is a highly interdisciplinary topic. As a term, swarming is applied particularly to insects, but can also be applied to any other entity or animal that exhibits swarm behaviour. The term flocking or murmuration can refer specifically to swarm behaviour in birds, herding to refer to swarm behaviour in tetrapods, and shoaling or schooling to refer to swarm behaviour in fish. Phytoplankton also gather in huge swarms called blooms, although these organisms are algae and are not self-propelled the way animals are. By extension, the term "swarm" is applied also to inanimate entities which exhibit parallel behaviours, as in a robot swarm, an earthquake swarm, or a swarm of stars.
From a more abstract point of view, swarm behaviour is the collective motion of a large number of self-propelled entities. From the perspective of the mathematical modeller, it is an emergent behaviour arising from simple rules that are followed by individuals and does not involve any central coordination. Swarm behaviour is also studied by active matter physicists as a phenomenon which is not in thermodynamic equilibrium, and as such requires the development of tools beyond those available from the statistical physics of systems in thermodynamic equilibrium. In this regard, swarming has been compared to the mathematics of superfluids, specifically in the context of starling flocks (murmuration).Swarm behaviour was first simulated on a computer in 1986 with the simulation program boids. This program simulates simple agents (boids) that are allowed to move according to a set of basic rules. The model was originally designed to mimic the flocking behaviour of birds, but it can be applied also to schooling fish and other swarming entities.},

	abstract = {Moneyball is a 2011 American biographical film directed by Bennett Miller and written by Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin. The film is based on the 2003 nonfiction book by Michael Lewis, an account of the Oakland Athletics baseball team's 2002 season and their general manager Billy Beane's attempts to assemble a competitive team. In the film, Beane (Brad Pitt) and assistant general manager Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), faced with the franchise's limited budget for players, build a team of undervalued talent by taking a sophisticated sabermetric approach to scouting and analyzing players.
Columbia Pictures bought the rights to Lewis's book in 2004, hiring Stan Chervin to write the screenplay. David Frankel was initially set to direct with Zaillian now writing the screenplay, but was soon replaced by Steven Soderbergh, who planned to make the film in a semi-documentary style featuring interviews from real athletes, and having the real players and coaches on the team portray themselves. However, prior to its July 2009 filming start, the film was put in turnaround due to creative differences between Soderbergh and Sony over a last-minute script rewrite. Soderbergh exited, and Miller was hired to direct, with Pitt becoming a producer and Sorkin being hired to provide rewrites. Filming began in July 2010, taking place at various stadiums such as Dodger Stadium and Oakland Coliseum.
Moneyball premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival and was released on September 23, 2011, to box office success and critical acclaim, particularly for its acting and screenplay. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor for Pitt and Best Supporting Actor for Hill.},
